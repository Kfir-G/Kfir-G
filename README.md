- [JamFinder](http://proj.ruppin.ac.il/gallery/#/rue42p10)
    My friends and I created JamFinder, an app that helps musicians find partners based on their musical preferences and Spotify listening data, using an algorithm based on SNA. The app filters, scores and ranks potential partners according to their proximity in a network of 2500 Spotify genres and 30 musical communities
- [Hack IDC 21 ](https://github.com/Kfir-G/HackIDC21_Project)
    Tool of home contents insurance without an insurance reviewer- consists of an algorithm that identifies objects in the space of the room with the help of a telephone camera and helps the user to quickly fill in insurance along with cross-referencing his personal details. With these components they gave insurance pricing to the user. The solution is agile and efficient with documentation and evidence used by both parties for transparency between them.
